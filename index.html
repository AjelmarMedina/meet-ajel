          <p>
            I am an avid enjoyer of problem solving and creating stuff I enjoy. I use programming not just as an outlet but as a potential source of income; as a career. I continue to seek opportunitie that help me grow not only a skill but a lifestyle of such.

          <p>
            My father is actually a musician and when I was just a wee boy back in the day, he used to casually take me to hos gigs at bars and the like. Matter of fact, even if my father was a musician, I've only tried to learn an instrument only recently. Music emanates such a strong emotion for me, every genre has made me feel motivated, comfortable, calm, energetic (as I suspect pther people do too.)

            Throughout the years, I've gained to realize that we learning is everywhere. Knowing this, I've been accustomed to utilizing anything for insights. No matter where we may be, it's nice to be like a tree and grow.

            Cat videos, memes, supporting each other, kindness, generosity, the list goes on for what absolutely beautiful people, what they have, and what they stand forcan be. I am happily inclined to supporting anyone who deserves it. I'm not afraid of making an impact no matter how large or small.
